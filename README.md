V2T-Foley-Script-Generator
This repository is dedicated to the foundational, first phase of a larger AI sound design pipeline. The goal is to build an advanced Video-to-Text (V2T) system that generates a detailed, multi-track audio "script" from any given video. This script will serve as the primary input for a future Text-to-Audio (T2A) or Text-Video-to-Audio (TV2A) model, automating the creative process of sound design.

The project is built by forking and enhancing an open-source video-LLM, specifically Video-LLaVA, as its foundational model.

üí° Core Concept: A Chain-of-Thought V2T Pipeline
Instead of a single, simple video caption, this project focuses on a sophisticated, multi-stage V2T pipeline that mimics a human sound designer's thought process. It uses a "chain-of-thought" approach where the model breaks down the task into smaller, more manageable steps to ensure a highly granular and accurate output. This approach is designed to generate multiple, distinct text descriptions for different audio layers.

Phase 1: Video Analysis & Categorization
This phase uses the multimodal capabilities of a Video-LLaVA-based model to analyze a video and perform the following tasks sequentially:

Event Identification: The model first identifies all significant audio-visual events in the video.

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: For each event (e.g., an airplane crashing), the model performs a series of internal reasoning steps to answer a structured set of questions:

What is the main object involved?

What is the primary action of that object?

What is the context or environment?

What are all the potential sounds that would occur as a result of this action?

Output Categorization: The model then takes the answers to these questions and synthesizes them into a structured output, categorized for multi-track audio generation.

Output of the Pipeline
The final output is a clean, machine-readable text format (e.g., JSON) that contains a set of text descriptions dedicated to each audio category. This is a crucial step that prepares the data for a future audio generation model.

‚öôÔ∏è Strategies for Achieving Granular Output
The project's success hinges on two key strategies:

Prompt Engineering (Initial Phase): This is the immediate focus of the project. Developers will craft and refine a set of detailed prompts that guide the Video-LLaVA model's "chain-of-thought" process. The goal here is to get the best possible results from the pre-trained model and, most importantly, to generate a high-quality dataset.

Fine-Tuning (Next Phase): Once a high-quality dataset of video-to-foley-script pairs is created using the prompt engineering strategy, a fine-tuning method like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) will be used. This will train the model to reliably produce the desired structured output with a single, simple prompt, making the pipeline more robust and efficient.

üöÄ Getting Started
Fork the Repository: Start by forking a strong open-source multimodal video model repository, such as Video-LLaVA, as your base. This is the recommended approach to maintain a clear connection to the original project.

Environment Setup: Install all necessary dependencies for the model.

Develop the V2T Script: Create a Python script that implements the chain-of-thought prompting strategy. Your script should be able to:

Load a video.

Feed video keyframes and a structured prompt to the model.

Parse the model's structured output into a usable format (e.g., a JSON file).

Experiment and Refine: Begin experimenting with different prompts and videos to build your custom dataset.

üéØ Next Steps & Future Work
Data Curation: Build a comprehensive dataset of video-to-foley-script pairs, which will be the most valuable asset for the next phase.

Fine-Tuning with LoRA: Use the curated dataset to fine-tune the LLaVA model to a specialized "foley-script-writer" model.

Integration: Once the V2T model is robust, it can be integrated into a full pipeline with a TV2A model like Hunyuan Video-Foley to generate the final audio.
